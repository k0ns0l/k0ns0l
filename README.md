### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on improving my knowledge of network security protocols and best practices, as I believe this is essential to staying ahead of evolving cyber threats.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about common cyber threats and how to identify and mitigate them - actively participating in various [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) events.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects that focus on improving accessibility in software engineering.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implementing secure coding practices and best practices for software development, as well as understanding different programming languages and frameworks.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about common tools used in software engineering and cybersecurity - to get the job done ;)

- âš¡ Fun fact: The first ever computer virus was called __*"Creeper"*__ and was created in 1971 by Bob Thomas, a programmer at BBN Technologies. The virus was designed to infect the ARPANET, a precursor to the modern-day internet, and displayed the message *"I'm the creeper: Catch me if you can."* The first antivirus software, called __*"Reaper"*__, was also created to remove the Creeper virus from infected machines.
