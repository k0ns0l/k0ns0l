### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on improving my knowledge of network security protocols and best practices, as I believe this is essential to staying ahead of evolving cyber threats.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The first ever computer virus was called __*"Creeper"*__ and was created in 1971 by Bob Thomas, a programmer at BBN Technologies. The virus was designed to infect the ARPANET, a precursor to the modern-day internet, and displayed the message *"I'm the creeper: Catch me if you can."* The first antivirus software, called __*"Reaper"*__, was also created to remove the Creeper virus from infected machines.
